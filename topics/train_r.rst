**Training session in R**
-------------------------

The goal of introR section is to get you acquainted with R, both the environment and the language. Weâ€™ll discuss data type manipulation, the structure of commands, how to get help and more information, how to load packages, and how to use the environment

The goal of advancedR section is to get a bit more into the depth of how to read, understand, and troubleshoot R code - by introducing loops, conditionals and functions which are a large part of R, and therefore a large part of understanding the syntax and function of the language. We will also introduce graphing and script creation in R.
